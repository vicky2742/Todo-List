# Todo-List
This is my second Task (Simple Todo List) of my internship delivered by Code Clause.

You can use Todoist to organize your tasks by creating projects and sub-projects. You can also add labels and filters to your tasks to help you find them more easily. Todoist also has a feature called “Karma” which tracks your productivity and gives you points for completing tasks on time.
